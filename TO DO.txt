Art:
Backgrounds
CGs (Can be literally just the end screen)
Props
UI
NPCs (If the NPCs are all Snippets, tons of reused assets with just different hats or whatever)
Character (playable Snippet = more reused assets for the NPCs)
Animations (Some games like Harvester had 0 frames of animation for most interactions. Player would need limited animations)
Talking Heads (Optional. If its all Snippets, its all reused with a funny hat or whatever.)
Puzzles (Can be very simplified. Actually probably really easy with free assets available for Godot)
Cursor (Grab, Speak, Look, Move, Change Scene. Might find a free one)

Sounds:
SFX - Can be stock sounds. I'm sure there's a bunch freely available with Godot
Music - Can be stock music/existing music/VAllure's BGM

Writing:
General gameplay progression
Puzzle making
Snippet dialogue
Item description/interaction text
Nothing needs to be voiced

Programming:
There is a ton of steps to go on in here but I'll oversimplify it
Pathing (easy if linear paths)
Inventory
Interaction
Puzzles
Text Boxes (Part of Interaction but whatever
